    <!-- Webpack
      Webpack takes all of our assets and outputs them to a production-ready bundle
      - Bundles Javascript files into one file, minimizing http requests
      - Process SASS/ LESS files into CSS and only use them where needed
      - Convert JSX or ES2015 into Vanilla JS which browsers understand
